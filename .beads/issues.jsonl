{"id":"agentbuffer-0ev","title":"Context: Project Brief","description":"# Project Brief\n\n## Overview\nAgentBuffer is a macOS menu bar app that acts as a pressure gauge for parallel coding agents. It reads live Codex session logs, computes a running/total ratio, colors the menu bar icon along a white → yellow → red gradient, and exposes a compact popover plus an optional local metrics dashboard for deeper operational visibility.\n\n## Goals\n- Provide a stable, ambient signal for running vs idle agent pressure\n- Replace noisy \"done\" alerts with state-based visuals and a single idle-threshold alert\n- Keep the core model simple (running/total ratio) while offering optional diagnostic metrics\n- Enable one-click focus back to the owning terminal tab when needed\n\n## Scope\n- macOS menu bar app with a popover UI (main, settings, efficiency info)\n- Read Codex session logs for live processes; infer running/idle states and runtimes\n- Idle-threshold alerts with optional sound + notification\n- Local-only metrics web server and dashboard with JSON endpoints\n- Optional, low-volume telemetry gated by Settings\n\n## Non-Goals\n- Per-agent deep-dive dashboards or task-level analytics\n- Progress prediction, scheduling, or agent orchestration\n- Cloud services or cross-platform support\n- High-frequency notifications or per-agent alerting\n","notes":"Migrated from memory-bank/projectbrief.md on 2026-01-19.","status":"open","priority":4,"issue_type":"chore","owner":"henry.perschk@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T16:40:05.665023+01:00","created_by":"Henry Perschk","updated_at":"2026-01-19T16:40:05.665023+01:00","labels":["beads","context"]}
