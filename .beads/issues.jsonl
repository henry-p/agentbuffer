{"id":"agentbuffer-0ev","title":"Context: Project Brief","description":"# Project Brief\n\n## Overview\nAgentBuffer is a macOS menu bar app that acts as a pressure gauge for parallel coding agents. It reads live Codex session logs, computes a running/total ratio, colors the menu bar icon along a white → yellow → red gradient, and exposes a compact popover plus an optional local metrics dashboard for deeper operational visibility.\n\n## Goals\n- Provide a stable, ambient signal for running vs idle agent pressure\n- Replace noisy \"done\" alerts with state-based visuals and a single idle-threshold alert\n- Keep the core model simple (running/total ratio) while offering optional diagnostic metrics\n- Enable one-click focus back to the owning terminal tab when needed\n\n## Scope\n- macOS menu bar app with a popover UI (main, settings, efficiency info)\n- Read Codex session logs for live processes; infer running/idle states and runtimes\n- Idle-threshold alerts with optional sound + notification\n- Local-only metrics web server and dashboard with JSON endpoints\n- Optional, low-volume telemetry gated by Settings\n\n## Non-Goals\n- Per-agent deep-dive dashboards or task-level analytics\n- Progress prediction, scheduling, or agent orchestration\n- Cloud services or cross-platform support\n- High-frequency notifications or per-agent alerting\n","notes":"Archived; rediscover from README.md or code when needed.

{"id":"agentbuffer-0qu","title":"Context: Active Context","description":"# Active Context\n\n## Current Focus\n- Maintain reliable Codex session detection (pgrep/ps + lsof) and log-tail parsing with bootstrap/shell filtering\n- Keep the menu bar UI minimal (ratio, queue icon gradient + shimmer + idle blink, bouncing dot)\n- Keep file watching for `.codex/sessions` with a 1s polling safety net\n- Maintain popover flows (main, settings, efficiency info) with glass styling and crossfades\n- Keep alerts, sound availability gating, and notification permission flow stable\n- Maintain local metrics dashboard + developer tooling (simulation, overrides)\n\n## Current Behavior\n- Queue icon uses a continuous white-to-yellow-to-red gradient based on running/total (more running = whiter) with shimmer when agents are running and blink when idle threshold is exceeded or no agents are detected\n- Status text shows running/total plus a bouncing dot spinner; paused state dims the icon and suppresses animations/alerts\n- Refresh loop uses a background queue plus a file watcher on `.codex/sessions` (root + recent year/month/day dirs, capped at 250) and a 1s polling fallback\n- Codex session parsing scans log tails for the latest user/assistant events, ignores bootstrap + shell-command messages, uses session meta instructions to filter, and treats compaction as assistant completion\n- Running list is sorted by longest runtime; runtime bars scale to the longest-running agent; idle list is derived from finished sessions; History shows recent finished transitions with Load more\n- Agent cards show OpenAI/Anthropic logo badges (fallback to monospaced text) and clipped task titles; cards are clickable across sections with hover highlights and pointer cursor\n- Main popover includes a pause button, summary row with an Efficiency info icon, Idle/Running/History sections, and footer actions (Metrics, Settings, Quit)\n- Efficiency popover shows a thumb gauge tinted to the pressure color, rotated by utilization, and a short contextual message\n- Settings popover uses accordion sections (Alerts/Privacy/Developer) with crossfade transitions and glass styling; Alerts include idle threshold slider with snap points + double-click reset, notification toggle, and sound mode segmented control with system availability notes; Privacy includes telemetry toggle; Developer includes force spinner, queue icon override slider, test notification, and simulate agents\n- Idle alert triggers on threshold crossings after being below it (or rising idle after launch), plays Glass/System sound based on availability, and posts a notification containing the most recent finished PID for click-to-focus\n- Notification permission flow shows a brief glass prompt window to ensure the app is active before requesting access\n- Local-only metrics web server runs in-process (127.0.0.1, auto-incremented port) serving a dashboard and `/api/summary`, `/api/timeseries`, `/api/health`; discovery info is written to Application Support\n- Metrics compute utilization, response time (median/p90), idle-over-threshold minutes, throughput, task supply rate, bottleneck index, rework rate, fragmentation, and long-tail runtime from session logs\n- Telemetry events are sent through OpenPanel via proxy when enabled; opt-in/out always allowed; no agent titles, PIDs, or file paths collected\n- Terminal tab focus uses PID→TTY lookup and AppleScript automation (iTerm2/Terminal); notification clicks focus the most recently finished agent\n- Single-instance lock prevents multiple running app instances; dev logging emits only on state/PID changes and dev watch exits when the app is manually closed\n\n## Next Steps\n- Add additional agent integrations (e.g., Claude Code)\n\n## Decisions \u0026 Considerations\n- Standard mode only; no predictions or scheduling\n- Metrics are local-only and derived from existing session logs\n- Task boundaries rely on agent-specific integrations\n- No reliable \"compaction started\" signal exists in Codex logs; only completion is logged\n","notes":"Archived; rediscover from README.md or code when needed.

{"id":"agentbuffer-unt","title":"Context: Product Context","description":"# Product Context\n\n## Why This Project Exists\nRunning multiple coding agents in parallel creates unpredictable completion times and frequent audio interruptions. AgentBuffer replaces that interrupt-driven workflow with an ambient, glanceable pressure gauge in the macOS menu bar and a local metrics view for deeper operator feedback.\n\n## Problems It Solves\n- Reduces context switches caused by audio completion alerts\n- Externalizes the mental bookkeeping of tracking many agent tabs\n- Scales to more concurrent agents without increasing cognitive load\n- Replaces terminal bell alerts with a single, threshold-based sound + notification cue\n- Surfaces operator bottlenecks (response time, idle over threshold) without adding instrumentation\n\n## How It Should Work\nThe app reads Codex session logs for live Codex processes and infers running/finished states from the latest user/assistant events (ignoring bootstrap and shell-command messages). It shows the running/total ratio and uses a continuous white → yellow → red color scale for the menu bar icon, where more running agents means better (whiter) pressure. The popover groups agents into Idle, Running, and History sections; running cards include runtime bars and all cards are clickable to refocus the owning terminal tab. The summary row includes an info icon that opens an \"Efficiency\" view, and the footer exposes Metrics (local dashboard), Settings, and Quit. Idle alerts can play a sound and send a macOS notification when the idle share crosses a configurable threshold. A local-only metrics server powers a dashboard and JSON endpoints covering utilization, response time, idle-over-threshold, throughput, and quality guardrails.\n\n## User Experience Goals\n- Ambient and readable at a glance\n- Simple, predictable signals without false precision\n- Optional deeper diagnostics without cluttering the menu bar UI\n- Local-first: metrics stay on-device; telemetry is opt-out and low volume\n","notes":"Archived; rediscover from README.md or code when needed.
